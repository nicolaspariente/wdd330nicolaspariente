    <h1>Week 3</h1>
    <h4>This week I spended time reading the SitePoint chapters required and creating the practice code to show.</h4>
    <a href="practice/practice.html"><h2>Practice Code</h2></a>
    <h4>The practice code demonstrates that I know how to use Events, Objects and Modify the DOM.</h4>
    <h4>I used Key Events to practice something new for me. The code changes the css of Objects by the arrow keys.</h4>
    <h4>Using good practices of coding I didn't change the CSS in the JavaScript. The JS just changes the Class and the style info is in the CSS file.</h4>
